# Data Cleaning Project

This repository contains exercises in **data cleaning and transformation** using `Python`. The main purpose of this repository is to practice the process of **cleaning raw data (dirty data)** (especially from `Kaggle`) into **data ready for analysis (clean data)**, while documenting each stage of cleaning in a separate folder.
